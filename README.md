# Mankey - Reddit's easy mode

[See the App here](https://mankey.netlify.app/)

Mankey is a high performance oriented app that seeks to bring Reddit's content to the client without the need of generating users, popups or downloading an app.

All the subreddits can be favorited (using a cookie-based system), post information parsed easily and posts can be easily shared through the clipboard.

High performance is seeked by not rendering or generating any extra-requests, only seeking the relevant and basic information needed for the best experience.

## Dev info

Built on React 18.2 and Redux using reduxjs/toolkit 1.8.5.

React-router based navigation. Subreddits can be accesed through the /r/{subReddit} path.
